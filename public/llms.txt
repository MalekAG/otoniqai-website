# Otoniq AI

> Industrial automation AI consulting company based in Amman, Jordan. We combine Siemens PLC/SCADA engineering expertise with artificial intelligence to deliver smart factory solutions, AI-powered documentation, and industrial process optimization for the Middle East and worldwide.

Otoniq AI bridges the gap between traditional industrial automation (PLC, SCADA, HMI) and modern AI. Founded by a PLC/SCADA systems engineer with hands-on experience in Siemens TIA Portal projects for the water sector, we bring real plant-floor knowledge to AI solutions — not just software theory.

We serve industrial companies, system integrators, and manufacturers across Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, and globally. Services available in English and Arabic.
